# üîó‚úÇÔ∏è Super URL shorter API

This project is my first attempt at a URL shortener. It's a simple web app that allows you to short any URL you want by API request. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good, I swear! It's also open source, so you can check out the code on this page.

## Features

nope now

## TODOes

create API with JSON request:

```json
{
    "url":"example.com"
}
```

and respond:

```json
{
    "short":"AAAAAA"
}
```
